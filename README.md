## Project Overview

McTastic Recipes is a recipe website. It is designed to be useful for people with different levels of abilities in the kitchen, from complete novice to experienced cook. It is also designed to be easy to navigate for users of all ages. 

### User Stories

_- User Story A: As a casual user I would to easily browse recipes. _  
_- User Story B: As a registered user I would like to add, edit, update or delete my own recipes. _  
_- User Story C: As a registered user I would like to be able to edit my profile. _  
_- User Story D: As a registered user I would like to save my favourite recipes. _  
_- User Story E: I would like to be able to view the recipes clearly regardless of the type of device I use. _  
_- User Story F: I would like confirmation of what I'm doing, such as when I've registered, logged in, added, edited or deleted a recipe. _

## UX Planes



### Strategy Plane

- Business Goals: The purpose of McTastic Recipes is to provide a platform for users to be able to casually view recipes or register to add and edit their own recipes. Users may store their own recipes so that they essentially have their own online personal cookbook while also being able to view other peoples recipes. 


- Audience: The audience of the site is broad and it cannot be assumed that even the registered users of the site will be technically savvy, it is therefore necessary to make the site easily navigable not just for casual users but also the registered users.

- Content: The content is determined by the users and presented in a uniform and clear manner.

#### Project Goals:

- 
- 
- 

#### User Goals:

- 
- 
- 
- 

#### Personal Goals

- To learn and practice frontend and backend programming together for the first time. To combine the use of HTML, CSS, Materialize and JavaScript with Python, MongoDB, Flask and Jinja.

### Scope Plane

- What is needed is a site which integrates input from users in a way which is clean, simple and easily navigable. Users must be able to upload photographs as well as provide information such as ingredients, instructions prep time etc...

- The data on each cat must be presented in a visually compelling way to encourage interaction with the site with the ultimate goal of finding a suitable home for every cat.

- Recipes are divided into categories of cooking baking and snacks, each page provides a selection of recipes.

- User profiles allow users to store their recipes in a convenient location.

- In the future a blog or video instructions for recipes may be integrated.


### Structure Plane

- The site users a consistent structure, a navbar is at the top of the page which allow a user to navigate the site and login if needed. A footer at the bottom provides copyright information and links to social media pages. The content is consistant with text kept to a minimum. Where information is to be provided drop down menus and binary options are provided where necessary for consistancy. 

- The number of clicks needed to reach any page is kept to a minimum. Sections such as user profiles will not be visible to users who are not logged in.


### Skeleton Plane

- Nav Bar: 
- Main: 
- Footer: Displays copyright information and provides links to social pages.


### Surface Plane

- The number is fonts is kept at a minimum as well as using a limited and consistant color scheme.

#### Design

A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

#### Color Scheme

Colors are kept to a minimum in order to keep focus on the imagery of the recipes, chosen colousr are various shades of grey. Color scheme can be found on my Coolors profile: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/u/sean_mcmahon)

![Color Palette](https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/McTasticRecipes/blob/master/wireframes/coolors.JPG)

#### Typography

2 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:

- [Pattaya](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pattaya?query=patt) : Logo & Headings, used for it's flowing relaxed style.
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse) : Body, used for it's excellent readability.

Font sizes for the headings are mostly responsive using the calc() function.

#### Media

All images, models and featured products are the authors own. Logos are also produced by the author.

#### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq and figma to create the wireframes. The layout has altered since I created the wireframes as I decided to replace the contact page with a newsletter sign up in the footer. The parallax felt too distracting and so that has been omitted.
I used affinity designer to design the logo, I went through many iterations of the design until I was happy with two final logos, one for the navigation bar on the site and the other for the browser tab icon.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Elements on every page
- Navbar
    - The navigation bar features the PCR logo in the top left corner. The logo and name are links to the home page.

    - For visitors to the site who are not logged in, list items links are available for them to use.
        1. Cooking
        2. Baking
        3. Snacks
        4. Contact
        5. Login
        6. Register

    - For users who are logged in, the list items are as follows: 
        1. Cooking
        2. Baking
        3. Snacks
        4. Contact
        5. Logout
        6. Profile
        7. Add Recipe

    - Python determines if the user is logged in or not by checking `if 'user' in session` and passes this data to Jinja to display the correct navbar for the user.

    - On small screens the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon on small screens.

- Footer
    - The footer features:
        - Copyright Information
        - Links to existing social media platforms.

## Features Left to Implement

- Blog.

- Option to provide video instructions.

- Floating to top button:
    - A floating button appears on the lower right of the screen when the user starts to scroll downwards. Clicking this moves the view back up to the top of the page. I added this feature because some pages can be quite long and the navbar is not fixed to the top of the page.
    - Adding the class `.active` to the `#to-top-button` changes it's `opacity` from `0` to `0.5`, which gave me the ability to animate the change gently. The opacity is increased again to `1` on hover.

## Deployment

CHANGE DEBUG=TRUE TO FALSE IN APP.PY PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT

1. I Created a Github account at https://github.com
   My account url; https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon

2. I installed Git and set up a username and password.

3. I created a repository on Github (https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/cat-rescue)

4. On VS Code I opened the command pallette and selected Git Clone, I pasted in the URL for the repo on GitHub and selected a folder on my computer to sync to.

5. I uploaded all files to my Github repository.

6. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it. Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/

7. To run this code on a local machine, you would go to my respository at
   https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/cat-rescue and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
   "Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
   To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/ Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
